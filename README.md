              <h3>🏢 Placester</h3>
              <p>Placester is a cutting-edge real estate platform that provides agents and brokers with powerful tools to create customized, SEO-ready websites without the need for coding. It integrates IDX listings and offers a wide range of features, from lead capture and management to advanced integrations with tools like Zapier, enhancing real estate professionals' online presence and operational efficiency.</p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 7.5px;">👨🏻‍💻 My role at Placester:</h3>
              <p>As a full-stack developer with Placester since 2018, I have played a pivotal role in developing and launching the core components of the Placester Codeless product. My work involves collaborating within a large, globally distributed engineering department consisting of 8 teams. I am deeply involved in several key repositories:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Placester Codeless Sites Framework</strong> - Developing and maintaining the foundational code for Placester sites.</li>
                  <li><strong>Placester Codeless Sites Editor</strong> - Building the application that enables site customization.</li>
                  <li><strong>Placester Toolbox</strong> - Handling database migrations, API interactions, and backend operations for the Placester platform.</li>
                  <li><strong>New Placester AI Powered product</strong> - Creating AI-driven content enhancements and integrating AI capabilities across the platform.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My technical expertise spans PHP, WordPress, JavaScript (including jQuery, TypeScript, React, and Next.js), Tailwind, SCSS, and Node.js. Notably, I was a team member of the team that won an in-house hackathon, creating a "Placester Admin Panel" mobile app prototype in Flutter.</p>
              <p>Though not in a formal leadership role, I have significant ownership over the Sites and Toolbox repositories, being the go-to expert for major features and decisions. My routine involves close collaboration with the Placester Product and Engineering Managers, contributing directly to our bi-weekly sprint releases, which are rigorously tested by our QA team.</p>
              <p>Throughout my tenure, I've also contributed to the Placester Services Portal and developed the Domain Buddy browser extension, further demonstrating my versatility and commitment to enhancing the user experience and operational efficiency at Placester.</p>
              <p>This dynamic role at Placester not only underlines my technical skills but also my ability to adapt and lead projects critical to the company’s success and customer satisfaction.</p>
